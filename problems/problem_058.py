# Name:       group_cities_by_state
# Parameters: a list of cities in the format "«name», «st»"
#             where «name» is the name of the city, followed
#             by a comma and a space, then the two-letter
#             abbreviation of the state
# Returns:    a dictionary whose keys are the two letter
#             abbreviations of the states in the list and
#             whose values are a list of the cities appearing
#             in that list for that state
